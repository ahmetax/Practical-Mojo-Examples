# Practical-Mojo-Examples
Practical Mojo Examples Especially For Beginners

In this repository I will try to share some practical and tested mojo examples.
My examples are written and tested on an Ubuntu machine.
These examples are generally for the beginner level.
Maybe in future I can also share some advanced examples.

I preferred pip installation of mojo. For the other installation methods
please refer to https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/install page.
My Python version is Python 3.12.

We will use the text files in gutenberg_org in some of our examples. These
files are shared in https://gutenberg.org and selected randomly.

## Cloning
mkdir github

cd github

git clone https://github.com/ahmetax/Practical-Mojo-Examples.git

cd Practical-Mojo-Examples

## Installation
python3.12 -m venv e312

source e312/bin/activate

pip install mojo

## Version check

mojo -v

## You can share your own examples

If you wish, you can share your own mojo examples also.
You can use a header on top of your code as follows:

"""

Author: Your name

Date: Creation date

Revision Date: Revision date

Mojo version no: x.y.z

"""

## Code List And Explanations

It is not very easy to get the topic of the codes just looking their names.

I will remove version numbers from file names, and transfer the source files
into sources-v0.26.1 folder.  I hope it will be more readable.

Tested Mojo version numbers will be included both in the table, and in the headers in the files.

Here is the table
